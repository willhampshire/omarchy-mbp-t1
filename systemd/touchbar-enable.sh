# Bring up the Apple T1 Touch Bar. Run late, from a systemd oneshot.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT RUNS LATE
#   At boot the generic HID drivers claim both iBridge interfaces, and hid-sensor-hub keeps
#   .0002 — the interface carrying the Touch Bar reports. apple_ibridge reclaims only .0001,
#   so appletb_probe never finds a device: no sysfs group, no input device, dark strip, and
#   no error anywhere. This takes .0002 back.
#
#   It runs after multi-user.target on purpose. Loading these modules from
#   /etc/modules-load.d/ hangs sysinit.target if anything wedges, and the only recovery is a
#   forced power-off. Late and slow beats early and fatal.
#
#   insmod, not modprobe: the kernel cmdline blacklists these modules so nothing can pull
#   them in early by accident. insmod ignores the blacklist, which keeps that guard intact
#   while still letting this script load them deliberately.

# and triggered a pointless module reload that leaked a stale input device each time.
